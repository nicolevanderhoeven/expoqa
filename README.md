# How to be a Gish

This repository contains the scripts used in the presentation _How to be Gish: API, browser, and chaos testing in one script_ by me, Nicole van der Hoeven, which I gave at the ExpoQA 2022 conference in Madrid, Spain.

You can also find the slides I used in the presentation [here](https://slides.nicolevanderhoeven.com/2022-how-to-be-a-gish/#/).
